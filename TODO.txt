Many things are still TODO:

* Rewrite hotspotlogin.cgi to use strict and warnings!

* Change hotspotlogin.cgi so that is uses TT templates, and remove all
that stuff in Italian language

* Make a better dispatcher in the admin script

* Use transactions in some key places

* Improve the administrative view of the list of users

* Some I18N support

* Make the whole thing less hotel-oriented

* Move configuration to a single conf file
